 ðŸ§  FoG Detection & Prediction

Freezing of Gait (**FoG**) is one of the most disabling motor symptoms in patients with **Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)**. It causes a sudden and temporary inability to move forward while walking, which increases the risk of **falls, injuries**, and reduced mobility.

This project aims to **detect** and **predict** FoG episodes using wearable sensor signals (e.g., accelerometers). By applying signal processing, feature engineering, and machine learning / deep learning techniques, we classify gait into:

- âœ… **Normal Gait**
- âœ… **Pre-FoG** 
- âœ… **FoG Event**

The long-term goal is to support real-time systems for **early intervention** and fall prevention.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

| Goal | Description |
|---------|------------|
| Preprocessing | Filter and normalize raw accelerometer signals |
| Windowing | Segment data into sliding windows with labels |
| Feature Extraction | Time, frequency, and time-frequency domain |
| Modeling | ML/DL for detection and prediction |
| Evaluation | F1-Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, PR-Curve |
| Deployment-Ready | Support for real-time inference |

## ðŸ“¡ Dataset
This project uses the **Daphnet Freezing of Gait Dataset**, collected from Parkinsonâ€™s disease subjects using wearable sensors during walking tasks.

> Note: Dataset is not included in the repository due to size â€” instructions for download will be provided in `data/raw/`.
